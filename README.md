# RSA: Secure Password Storage

### Statement
This project is an implementation of RSA. RSA is a an encryption system without a Racket Library. We would like to write a library to do RSA encryption in Racket. To test this we will be writing a secure password storage system.

### Analysis
We will be using recursion, map/filter/reduce, and object-orientation in our project. RSA will be implemented as no object using the message passing style. The search algorithm for retrieving passwords will make use of filter. Since, RSA depends heavily on primality we will implement a primality test using recursion.

### Data set or other source materials
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload it from a website? access it in a database? create it in a simulation you will build....)

How will you convert that data into a form usable for your project?  

Do your homework here: if you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materials, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
I will be handling the demonstration plan, how it will be presented and the power points.

### Evaluation of Results
<<<<<<< HEAD
The success of this project will be measured by the ability to store passwords with usernames and website names in an encrypted text file and retrieve them correctly on a search by website name.
=======
How will you know if you are successful?
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be good.

## Architecture Diagram
I will be handling the Diagram/Uml of the project.

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product.

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc.

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system.

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
Working Algorithm to the program. Prototype UI for the program.

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
Working Ui to the project.

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
Algorithm and UI talking with each other.

**Additional instructions for teams of three:**
* Remember that you must have prior written permission to work in groups of three (specifically, an approved `FP3` team declaration submission).
* The team must nominate a lead. This person is primarily responsible for code integration. This work may be shared, but the team lead has default responsibility.
* The team lead has full partner implementation responsibilities also.
* Identify who is team lead.

In the headings below, replace the silly names and GitHub handles with your actual ones.

### Michael Bowe @mgbowe1
I will write the RSA algorithm since I've been studying cryptography in Discrete Structures II. I will also write the ui regarding password insertion.

### Aliyu Zakari @ABZaxxon
I will be handling the presentation part of the project.
